# About me
I am from Russia and currently work as a teacher. However, recently, I have realized that I want to change my career path. The reason for this is because I feel like I am in a rut and there is no room for growth. I have a realistic approach to life and understand that I might fail, but I would still try to pursue a new opportunity in order to gain new experience.I am an open-minded individual and I am always excited to face new challenges.
